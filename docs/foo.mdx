# üèó Server Side Rendering

**Jaspr** is built to be server-side-rendering first. It leverages the power of Darts
cross-compilation to both js and native executables to execute the same app on the server and client.

For each target (server and client) you need to have a separate entrypoint to start your app. However 
depending on what project setup you choose, the web entrypoint might be automatically generated for you.

1. The entrypoint on the web will always be the corresponding file inside the `web` directory,
   usually `web/main.dart`. This file will be compiled to js and is included in the `index.html` file
   as a script: `<script defer src="main.dart.js"></script>`

2. The entrypoint on the server will:
    - be the file specified using the `-i (--input)` option when running `jaspr serve` or `jaspr build` or
    - default to `lib/main.dart`

## üíΩ Loading Data on the Server

When using server side rendering, you want the ability to load some data data before rendering the html.
With `jaspr` this is build into the package and easy to do.

Start by using the `PreloadStateMixin` on a `StatefulComponent`s `State` class and implement the `Future<T> preloadState()` method.

```dart
class MyState extends State<MyStatefulComponent> with PreloadStateMixin {
  
  @override
  Future<void> preloadState() async {
    ...
  }
}
```

This method will only be executed on the server and will be called before `initState()`. It will defer
`initState()` as well as building the component until the future returned by the method is completed.

> While it is only executed on the server it still will be compiled for the client, since Dart does not have
> selective compilation. So you have to make sure it will compile on the client, e.g. by using service locators
> and providing mock services on the client. (TODO: More explanation and How To)

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Syncing Data to the Client

Alongside with preloading some data on the server, you often want to also sync the data with the client.
You can simply add the `SyncStateMixin` which will automatically sync state from the server with the client.

The `SyncStateMixin` accepts a second type argument for the data type that you want to sync. You the have to
implement the the `getState` and `updateState()` methods.

```dart
class MyState extends State<MyStatefulComponent> with SyncStateMixin<MyStatefulComponent, MyStateModel> {

  MyStateModel? model;
  
  // a globally unique id that is used to identify the state
  @override
  String get syncId => 'my_id';

  // this will get the state to be sent to the client
  // and is only executed on the server
  @override
  MyStateModel? getState() {
    return model;
  }

  // this will receive the state on the client
  // and it is safe to call setState
  void updateState(MyStateModel? value) {
    setState(() {
      model = value;
    });
  }
}
```

In order to send the data, it needs to be serialized on the server and deserialized on the client.
The serialization format is defined by the `syncCodec` getter defined in `SyncStateMixin`.

The codec must encode to a primitive or object value of one of the supported types: `Null, bool,
double, int, Uint8List, String, Map, List`. By default, the codec is null and your state must
already be one of the supported types.

When you want to use another type like a custom model class, you have to override the `syncCodec` getter, which
has to return a `Codec` that encodes to `String`. This can be any codec, however a typical use would be to
encode your model to `Map<String, dynamic>` and the fuse this with the json codec to get a json string.

```dart

class MyState extends State<MyStatefulComponent> with SyncStateMixin<MyStatefulComponent, MyStateModel> {

  @override
  Codec<MyStateModel, String> get syncCodec => MyStateModelCodec();

  ...
}

// codec that encodes a value of MyStateModel to Map<String, dynamic>
class MyStateModelCodec extends Codec<MyStateModel, Map<String, dynamic>> {
  
  ...
  
}
```

## üîÄ Integrate with other backend framework

When you use `runApp(App())` on the server-side, jaspr spins up its own http server to serve all
incoming requests. However depending on your app, you may want to add your own request handling and
server setup, e.g. if you want to add an api to your application.

Jaspr provides two ways to control the server setup:


#### 1. Extend the default request handling by adding middleware to `ServerApp`.

On the server, the `runApp()` function will actually return an instance of `ServerApp` where you can
extend the server and request handling of your application.
To make this available, change your jaspr import to `import 'package:jaspr/jaspr_server.dart';`. Then
chain some calls after the `runApp()` function, e.g. `runApp(App()).addMiddleware(someShelfMiddleware)`.
Jaspr uses `package:shelf` for this to be compatible with most common dart backends. You can also:

- add a listener using `.setListener((server) { ... })`.
  This will run the callback when the http server first started listening for requests, and then
  each time the app is reloaded through auto-reload.

- add a builder using `.setBuilder((handler) => myHttpServerImpl(handler))`.
  A builder has to return a `HttpServer`, which will completely replace the default server created
  by jaspr.

- check out [the server_handling example](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/tree/main/experiments/server_handling) to see this in action.


#### 2. Add jaspr to any existing backend implementation / framework as a **shelf handler**.

Instead of letting jaspr run your app and manage your http server, you can also use your favourite
backend package or framework, and simply add jaspr as a request handler to your implementation.

To do this, remove the `runApp()` call and setup your backend as you normally would. When defining your
route handlers, create a handler for jaspr by using `serveApp` like this:
```dart
var handler = serveApp((request, render) {
// Optionally do something with `request`
print("Request uri is ${request.requestedUri}");
// Return a server-rendered response by calling `render()` with your root component
return render(App());
});

// provide `handler` to your app, e.g.
await shelf_io.serve(handler, InternetAddress.anyIPv4, 8080);
```

Check out [the shelf_handler example](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/tree/main/experiments/shelf_handler) to see this in action.

**Be aware** that using the `serveApp` handler does not work with auto-reload. When building a simple
shelf backend, it is better to use `runApp()` with a custom `.setBuilder()` to keep this functionality.

**Make sure** that you set the base path of your app when mounting the `serveApp` handler to
any other route prefix than `/`, otherwise your static resources like `styles.css` or `main.dart.js`
can't be loaded correctly. Add the `<base href="/<route_prefix>/">` tag to the `head` of your
`index.html`, as demonstrated in the example.
