# Bootstrap Command

This command initializes the workspace, links local packages together and installs remaining package dependencies.

```bash
melos bootstrap
# or
melos bs
```

Bootstrapping has two primary functions:

1. Installing all package dependencies (internally using `pub get`).
2. Locally linking any packages together via path dependency overrides _without having to edit your pubspec.yaml_.

## Why is bootstrapping required?

In normal projects, packages can be linked by providing a `path` within the `pubspec.yaml`. This works for small
projects however presents a problem at scale. Packages cannot be published with a locally defined path, meaning
once you're ready to publish your packages you'll need to manually update all of the packages `pubspec.yaml` files
with the versions. If your packages are also tightly coupled (dependencies of each other), you'll also have to manually
check which versions should be updated. Even with a small number of packages this can become a long and error-prone task.

Melos solves this problem by overriding local files which the Dart analyzer uses to read packages from. If a local package
exists (defined in the `melos.yaml` file) and a different local package has it listed as a dependency, it will be linked
regardless of whether a version has been specified.




## Combining with filters

Bootstrap supports [all package filtering options](/filters), therefore if you wanted to you could bootstrap only a specific subset of your packages, for example:

```bash
# Only bootstrap packages that have
# changed since the main branch.
melos bootstrap --since="main"
```

## Adding a postboostrap lifecycle script

Melos supports various command lifecycle hooks that can be defined in your `melos.yaml`.

For example, if you needed to run something such as a build runner automatically after `melos bootstrap` is ran, you can add a
`postbootstrap` script:

```yaml
# melos.yaml
# ...
scripts:
  postbootstrap: dart pub run build_runner build
# ...
```

This is useful to ensure any local project requirements, such as generated files being built, are met when anyone is working on
your mono repo code base, e.g. external contributors.
