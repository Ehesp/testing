# Server Side Rendering

**Jaspr** is built to be server-side-rendering first. It leverages the power of Darts
cross-compilation to both js and native executables to execute the same app on the server and client.

For each target (server and client) you need to have a separate entrypoint to start your app. However 
depending on what project setup you choose, the web entrypoint might be automatically generated for you.

1. The entrypoint on the web will always be the corresponding file inside the `web` directory,
   usually `web/main.dart`. This file will be compiled to js and is included in the `index.html` file
   as a script: `<script defer src="main.dart.js"></script>`

2. The entrypoint on the server will:
    - be the file specified using the `-i (--input)` option when running `jaspr serve` or `jaspr build` or
    - default to `lib/main.dart`
